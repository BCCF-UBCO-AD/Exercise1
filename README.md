# Exercise1

## Branching
Prepend feature branches with `feat-`

## Merge Conflicts
When merge conflicts arise we are each responsible for resolving them on our own. They will be reviewed in the pull requests, along with the point of the PR.
Using a merge resolution tool such as sublime merge is recommended.

(This tool can also be used for simply making commits)

### IMPORTANT
Resolve appropriately! READ the code and decide what version of a line/block is used to resolve the conflict. And, if necessary, modify the code to resolve conflicts or easily identified bugs.
